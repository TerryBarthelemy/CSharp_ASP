    When I was young me and my mama had beef
    Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
    Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
    Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
    Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
    With the big boys, breaking all the rules
    I shed tears with my baby sister
    Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
    And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
    When things went wrong we'd blame mama
    <br />
